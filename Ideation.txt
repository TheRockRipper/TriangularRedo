Themes:

- Plain White / Greyscale

- Foresty; Fireboy & Watergirl

- Pencil Sketches in a notebook

- Crystal Palace

- Research Facility


What the player should experience:

- Challenge; the player should learn from trying to overcome the challenge

- Surprise; visually and through mechanics

- Curiosity



Objectives:

1. Fit the triangle into a slot(finish point)

Interactable:

	Environment: 1. Buttons(Maybe)

		     2. Sticky Platforms

	UI: 1. Angles reset button

	    2. Level reset button


The character will start as an equilateral triangle.


Mechanics:

1. The sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees; The shape of the triangle can be varied by changing the angles.

2. Moving; the triangle will move by rotating and falling on its consecutive faces.

3. Shifting; slowly moving without rotating.

4. Shaping; changing the shape of the triangle using the mouse.

5. Stretchability limit; in order to ensure that the triangle isn't stretched too much, the sum of all sides will be constant.

6. Side preference; the side on which the triangle rests cannot be edited,i.e. only the vertex in the air can be moved

7. Hanging by vertices on particular surfaces.


Obstacles:

- Pits

- Vertical surfaces / Walls

- Moving platforms

- Air drafts / Vertical or Horizontal Force Fields
